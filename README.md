# ProgrammingToys
This is a repository for all of my small projects that don't necessarily warrant a dedicated repo, but would like to have available.

The current projects in the repo are:

### Python
- [Tree Level Traversal](https://github.com/Jonnyas93/ProgrammingToys/tree/main/Tree%20Level%20Traversal)
- [Coordinate Text Decoder](https://github.com/Jonnyas93/ProgrammingToys/tree/main/Coordinate%20Text%20Decoder)
- [Longest Alternate Substring](https://github.com/Jonnyas93/ProgrammingToys/tree/main/Edabit%20Challenges)
